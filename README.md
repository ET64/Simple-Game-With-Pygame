<p> In this game, the player controls a spaceship and tries to avoid the incoming enemy spaceships. The player can move left or right using the arrow keys. The enemy spaceships move down the screen and the player needs to avoid colliding with them. The enemy's speed increases gradually. The score increases each time the player successfully avoids an enemy spaceship. The game is over if the player collides with an enemy spaceship. The game also includes a game over screen displaying the final score. </p>

  In case you don't have python installed, you can install it from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

After installing python, if you don't have pygame installed, open your default terminal and paste this code: pip install pygame.

Now, copy paste all the code from the file "main.py" to your default text editor. Finally, run the file!!!
